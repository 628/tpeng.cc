As a founder of TPE (<a href="https://tpeng.cc" target="_blank" style="color: #915EFF;">website</a>), I lead a team dedicated to promoting electronics and STEM education through open-source projects. My responsibilities includes both conceptualizing and executing these projects while also maintaining the website / writing extended documentation. The organization is still in its infancy but we hope to build up a large portfolio of multidiciplinary projects!
