At NSI, I focused on cost reduction and process optimization. I designed and built an in-house flashing jig, saving ~85% per unit, and identified ~$20k in potential savings through a detailed value analysis. Additionally, I resolved supply chain delays by negotiating with third-party vendors, improving lead times for critical components. These projects enhanced my technical skills and provided valuable experience in cost management and engineering process improvements.
